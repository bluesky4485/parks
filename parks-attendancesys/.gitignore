# Directory based project format (.idea directory) - This format is used by all the recent IDE versions by default. Here is what you need to share:
# -> All the files under .idea directory in the project root except the workspace.xml and tasks.xml files which store user specific settings
# -> All the .iml module files that can be located in different module directories (applies to IntelliJ IDEA)
workspace.xml
tasks.xml

# Be careful about sharing the following:
# -> Android artifacts that produce a signed build (will contain keystore passwords)
# -> In IDEA 13 and earlier dataSources.ids, datasources.xml can contain database passwords. IDEA 14 solves this problem - http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-127105#comment=27-765064
dataSources.ids
datasources.xml

# You may consider not to share the following:
# -> gradle.xml file, see this discussion - http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-55923
# -> user dictionaries folder (to avoid conflicts if other developer has the same name)
# -> XML files under .idea/libraries in case they are generated from Gradle project
gradle.xml

# IDEA - Legacy project format (.ipr/.iml/.iws files)：
# Share the project .ipr file and all the .iml module files, don't share the .iws file as it stores user specific settings
# *.iml
# *.ipr
*.iws
